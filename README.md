# Restaurant Delivery Service

## Decription

Read in a JSON file "restaurant.txt" containing various information regarding the restaurants and their menus. Convert JSON to class (Hint use google gson). Here's a sample JSON:
```
{
"data": [
{
"name": "Boba Guys",
"address": "1670 Beverly Blvd", "latitude": 34.063950,
"longitude": -118.265360,
"drivers": 2,
"menu": [
"strawberry matcha milk tea", "black sesame latte",
"thai tea"
]
},
{
"name": "Twinkle Brown Sugar", "address": "131 S Central Ave", "latitude": 34.048160,
"longitude": -118.239240,
"drivers": 3,
"menu": [
"brown sugar milk tea", "mango tango green tea", "rose lychee green tea", "brown sugar fluffy coffee",
"sea salt iced coffee", "strawberry green milk tea"
]
},
{
"name": "One Zo",
"address": "500 N Atlantic Blvd", "latitude": 34.068280,
"longitude": -118.133680,
"drivers": 1,
"menu": [
"one zo boba milk tea", "caramel milk tea", "honey green tea",
"one zo fruit tea"
]
}
]
}
```
Aside from the JSON file, you will need to read in a second file "schedule.txt". Below is a layout of the second text file, which contains information for the orders:
```
0, Boba Guys, strawberry matcha milk tea
0, Twinkle Brown Sugar, sea salt iced coffee 1, One Zo, caramel milk tea
5, Boba Guys, black sesame latte 18, One Zo, one zo boba milk tea
18, Twinkle Brown Sugar, strawberry green milk tea 25, Twinkle Brown Sugar, rose lychee green tea
```
- The first parameter indicates when the order is ready.
- The second parameter indicates the location that the order is coming from.
- The third parameter indicates which food is being delivered.

To make it simple, use one second to travel one mile as speed for all drivers. Use the distance formula (based on latitude and longitude on map) to calculate how many seconds it will take for a driver to deliver food, and how many seconds to return to the restaurant. You can assume that each driver will only travel back and forth between one restaurant, and the order is not completed until the driver returns to the restaurant. 

The number of drivers allocated to each restaurant will be in the "restaurant.txt" file. Note that each driver will need to operate in a separate thread so other drivers can execute while one is currently out on a delivery. You will need to have a timer, which can be implemented in multiple ways, but one way is using Thread.sleep(1000). The 1000 represents 1000 milliseconds, or 1 second, which is what you would work for this assignment. To make sure a driver canâ€™t be assigned more than one order, you will need to use a lock.


## Execution

First, prompt the user to enter a filename and check for the file's existence and validity when the program first runs. You will also prompt the user for the latitude and longitude of their current location. For testing purposes, you may set latitude to 34.021160 and longitude to 118.287132. You will need to utilize locks and conditions to settle the availability of the drivers. For example, one driver cannot take two orders at the same time. The first trip must be completed before starting the second trip. The program should output when an order is picked up and when it is completed.

Below is an example of output. Your output may not match exactly because of the use of threads, but the format needs to be exactly the same.
